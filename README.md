### License

License : if you modify the Fixin source code, you should contribute those modifications back to the community.
Implementation: AGPLv3

#### Licensing FAQ

*If I write a worker or dispatcher for specific API, do I have to give it away to everyone?*

No. The AGPL requires that if you make a derivative work and distribute it to someone else, you must provide that person with the source code under the terms of the AGPL so that they may modify and redistribute it under the terms of the GPL as well. However, you are under no obligation to distribute the code to anyone else. If you do not distribute the code but use it only within your organization, then you are not required to distribute it to anyone at all.

However, if your work is of general use then it is often a good idea to contribute it back to the community anyway. You can get feedback, bug reports, and new feature patches from others who find it useful.

*If I modify Fixin source code, do I have to contribute the modification back?*

Yes. Hopefully it's your intention anyway. Please send me a pull request.

*Are you open to my suggestions on changing the license*

Yes. I admit being a noob at licensing. AGPLv3 was chosen because it "seemed right", not because it was recommended by a lawyer.

# Platform, not a Framework

The difference between a platform and a framework is whether it's useful on it's own. Fixin is useful on its own, because you don't have to write code to use built-in recipes. Therefore, Fixin is a platform.

Fixin is more like Wordpress than Meteor.

Wordpress has plugins. Fixin has workers. Both plugins and workers extend the core system.
